    "# Tutorial 5: Building an Email Search Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks through a complete, real-world use case: building and training an agent that can search a database of emails to answer user questions. This example, located in `examples/07_email_search_agent/`, demonstrates many of ToolBrain's advanced features, including custom tools, complex reward functions, and a full experiment workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build an agent that can intelligently use two tools, `search_emails` and `read_email`, to navigate the Enron email dataset and find answers to questions like \"When is Shari's move to Portland targeted for?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a multi-step reasoning task. The agent must first devise a search query, execute it, read the relevant email(s), and then synthesize an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Setting Up the Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to set up the email database. The Enron email dataset will be downloaded from Hugging Face and loaded into a local SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the setup script from the project root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m examples.07_email_search_agent.1_setup_enron_environment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This script will create the file `data/enron_emails.db`, which the agent's tools will interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: The Tools of the Trade\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent's capabilities are defined in `examples/07_email_search_agent/email_tools.py`. It has two primary tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`search_emails(...)`**: This tool performs a keyword search on the email database. It can filter by sender, recipient, and date. It returns a list of matching emails with their `message_id` and a short `snippet`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`read_email(message_id: str)`**: This tool takes a `message_id` from a search result and retrieves the full content of that email, including the subject, sender, recipients, and body.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools work in tandem, mimicking how a human would use a search engine: search first, then click to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: The Training Script\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of this example is `2_run_training_experiments.py`. This script orchestrates the entire training and evaluation process. Let's look at the key parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration (`config.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "All important parameters are stored in `config.py`. This includes:\n",
    "- `BASE_MODEL_ID`: The language model to be fine-tuned.\n",
    "- `JUDGE_MODEL_ID`: The LLM to use for the `art_judge` reward function.\n",
    "- `GRPO_CONFIG` and `DPO_CONFIG`: Hyperparameters for each learning algorithm.\n",
    "- `SYSTEM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`: A detailed prompt that sets the context for the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Reward Functions (`custom_rewards.py`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This use case introduces two custom reward functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`reward_f1_score`**: A fast, lexical-based reward that calculates the F1 score between the agent's answer and the ground truth. It's objective but can be brittle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`reward_art_style_judge`**: A more advanced reward function that uses an external LLM (the \"judge\") to determine if the agent's answer is semantically correct. It also includes a small bonus for efficiency (fewer turns). This allows for more nuanced and robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running an Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The script is designed to be run from the command line, allowing you to easily experiment with different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To train with GRPO and the LLM-as-a-Judge reward:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m examples.07_email_search_agent.2_run_training_experiments \\\n",
    "    --algorithm GRPO \\\n",
    "    --reward_function art_judge \\\n",
    "    --output_dir ./models/art_e_grpo_art_judge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**To train with DPO and the F1 score reward:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m examples.07_email_search_agent.2_run_training_experiments \\\n",
    "    --algorithm DPO \\\n",
    "    --reward_function f1 \\\n",
    "    --output_dir ./models/art_e_dpo_f1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "During the run, the script will periodically evaluate the agent on a held-out test set and save the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Evaluation and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: The script `run_evaluation_art_style.py` provides a standalone way to evaluate a trained agent, faithfully replicating the methodology from the ART-E paper on which this example is based.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plotting**: After training, you can visualize the learning curves using `4_plot_learning_curves.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m examples.07_email_search_agent.4_plot_learning_curves \\\n",
    "        --results_files ./models/art_e_grpo_art_judge/validation_history_art.json \\\n",
    "        --labels \"GRPO_with_ART_Judge\" \\\n",
    "        --output_image learning_curve.png\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Live Demo with Gradio\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a trained model, you can interact with it live using the Gradio web interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m examples.07_email_search_agent.3_gradio_live_demo \\\n",
    "    --model_dir ./models/art_e_grpo_art_judge\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will launch a web server with a chat interface where you can ask your trained agent questions about the Enron emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This email search agent example showcases the power and flexibility of ToolBrain for building sophisticated, multi-step agents and systematically improving their performance through targeted reinforcement learning."
