    "# Tutorial 8: Managing Many Tools with Tool Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build more complex agents, the number of available tools can grow quickly. An agent with dozens or even hundreds of tools faces a significant challenge: the more tools it has, the larger the context it must consider, and the higher the chance of it becoming confused or selecting the wrong one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool Retrieval** is ToolBrain's solution to this problem. It acts as an intelligent filter, dynamically selecting a small, relevant subset of tools based on the user's query, and presenting only those to the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the example in `examples/06_tool_retrieval.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Context Overload\n",
    "\n",
    "When an agent is initialized, the descriptions (docstrings) of all its tools are injected into its system prompt. If you have 50 tools, the system prompt can become enormous. This not only consumes valuable context window space but can also overwhelm the agent, making it harder for it to identify the single best tool for the job.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: `ToolRetriever`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ToolRetriever` is a component that sits between your full toolset and the agent. Before the agent begins its reasoning process, the retriever steps in.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You provide the `ToolRetriever` with your full list of tools.\n",
    "2.  When a query comes in, the `ToolRetriever` uses a separate, external language model (often a fast and cheap one like `gpt-4o-mini`) to read the query and the docstrings of all available tools.\n",
    "3.  Based on semantic relevance, it selects a small number of tools that are most likely to be useful for solving the query.\n",
    "4.  Only this filtered subset of tools is passed to the agent for the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the agent works with a clean, minimal, and highly relevant set of tools for every single query, dramatically improving its focus and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Code: `06_tool_retrieval.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the example script to see how to implement this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Define a Larger Set of Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we define several tools. In a real-world scenario, this list could be much longer."
