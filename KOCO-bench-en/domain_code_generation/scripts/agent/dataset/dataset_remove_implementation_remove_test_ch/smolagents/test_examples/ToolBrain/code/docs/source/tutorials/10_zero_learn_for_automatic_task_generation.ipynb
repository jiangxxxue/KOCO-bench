    "# Tutorial 9: Automatic Task Generation with Zero-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant bottlenecks in training a new agent is creating a high-quality, diverse training dataset. Manually writing dozens or hundreds of example queries is tedious and may not cover all the edge cases your agent needs to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "ToolBrain's \"zero-learn\" capability, exposed through the `brain.generate_training_examples()` method, solves this problem by using a language model to automatically generate training data for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the example in `examples/03_generate_training_examples.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: The Cold Start\n",
    "\n",
    "When you've just created a new agent with a new set of tools, you have a \"cold start\" problem: you have no data to train it on. How do you teach a finance agent to use a `calculate_compound_interest` tool without manually writing every possible question a user might ask about it?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Solution: `generate_training_examples()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This method leverages a language model to act as a creative user, generating a variety of queries that are relevant to the tools you've provided. You simply give it a high-level description of the task, and it does the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You provide a `task_description` that outlines the agent's purpose (e.g., \"a finance agent that can calculate interest and loan payments\").\n",
    "2.  You also provide the agent's tools.\n",
    "3.  The method prompts an LLM, asking it to generate a specified number of user queries that would require the use of these tools to answer.\n",
    "4.  Optionally, it can even use the same LLM to rank the generated examples, ensuring the most relevant and well-formed queries are prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Code: `03_generate_training_examples.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this works in the finance agent example."
