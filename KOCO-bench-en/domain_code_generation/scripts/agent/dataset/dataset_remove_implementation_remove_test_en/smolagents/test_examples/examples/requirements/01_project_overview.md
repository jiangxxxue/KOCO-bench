# SmolAgents Advanced Examples System

## 1. Project Overview

This example demonstrates an advanced application system built on the SmolAgents framework, implementing complete application scenarios from multi-model integration to complex execution environments.

## 2. Implementation Features

### Multi-Model Integration Architecture
- Supports multiple backends including InferenceClientModel, LiteLLMModel, TransformersModel, etc.
- Implements multi-model load balancing through LiteLLMRouterModel
- Dynamically switches between different model providers and execution environments

### Advanced Tool System
- Multi-functional toolset: weather queries, currency conversion, news retrieval, time queries, etc.
- RAG integration: Retrieval-augmented generation based on ChromaDB and BM25
- SQL interaction: Intelligent query tools for direct database interaction
- Structured output: Structured data output through MCP protocol

### Secure Execution Environments
- Sandboxed execution: Supports multiple execution environments including Docker, E2B, Modal, WebAssembly, etc.
- Isolated execution: Ensures security and controllability of code execution

### Async and Server Integration
- Async support: Agent integration in async frameworks like Starlette
- Web services: Building HTTP-based agent services
- MCP protocol: Extending agent capabilities through Model Context Protocol

### Advanced Application Scenarios
- Deep research: Open-source implementation of OpenAI Deep Research
- Plan customization: Human-in-the-loop plan customization and execution
- Performance evaluation: Comprehensive agent benchmarking framework

## 3. Application Scenarios

- Multi-model agent systems
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications
- Secure code execution environments
- Async web service integration
- Complex research task automation
