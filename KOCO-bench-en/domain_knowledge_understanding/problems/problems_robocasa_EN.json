      "stem": "The framework must handle the computational challenge of simulating complex scenes with many objects. What is the primary strategy for managing simulation performance?\n\n- (A) Using level-of-detail (LOD) systems that simplify distant objects\n- (B) Implementing spatial partitioning (octrees/BVH) for efficient collision detection\n- (C) Setting lite_physics=True to reduce MuJoCo solver iterations while maintaining sufficient accuracy for manipulation, combined with careful control frequency selection (20Hz)\n- (D) Offloading physics computation to GPU using MuJoCo's CUDA backend",
      "explanation": "This tests understanding of performance optimization across kitchen.py and MuJoCo configuration. (C) is correct - Kitchen.__init__ explicitly sets lite_physics=True and control_freq=20. lite_physics reduces solver iterations (fewer constraint solver passes), trading some accuracy for speed. The 20Hz control frequency balances responsiveness with computational cost. This is the primary performance strategy visible in the codebase. (A) is incorrect - no LOD system exists. (B) is incorrect - MuJoCo handles collision detection internally; no custom spatial partitioning is implemented. (D) is incorrect - MuJoCo 3.2.6 doesn't use GPU for physics (only rendering).",

Which quality control mechanisms are implemented?\n\n- (A) The exclude lists in OBJ_CATEGORIES remove specific object instances with known defects (holes, inconsistent normals, inertia violations)\n- (B) Automated mesh validation checks for watertight geometry, manifold edges, and proper UV mapping\n- (C) Different scale factors for aigen vs objaverse assets compensate for inconsistent real-world sizing across sources\n- (D) Object instances are manually curated and tested before inclusion in the asset library\n- (E) The framework automatically repairs mesh defects using hole-filling and remeshing algorithms",
      "explanation": "This tests understanding of asset quality control across kitchen_objects.py and asset management. (A) is correct - OBJ_CATEGORIES contains exclude lists with comments explaining defects (e.g., 'bagel_8' excluded, 'bar_1' has holes, 'can_5' has inconsistent orientation). (C) is correct - different scale values for aigen vs objaverse indicate manual calibration for size consistency. (D) is correct - the existence of curated exclude lists and specific scale factors indicates manual curation. (B) is incorrect - no automated validation code exists in the codebase.
