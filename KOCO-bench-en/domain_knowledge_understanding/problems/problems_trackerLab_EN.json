      "explanation": "(B), (C), and (E) are correct. This tests deep understanding of sim-to-sim transfer challenges across `sim2simlib/model/sim2sim_base.py`, `sim2simlib/model/config.py`, and the joint mapping system. (B) is critical - the `policy_joint_names` configuration and joint reordering logic in Sim2SimLib directly address this. (C) reflects the frame convention differences requiring gravity orientation transformations. (E) captures the data structure mismatch requiring observation reshaping. (A) is a performance difference, not an architectural mapping requirement.

      "explanation": "(A) and (D) are correct. This tests motor modeling domain knowledge from `sim2simlib/model/actuator_motor.py`. The DC motor model uses: τ_max(q̇) = τ_sat * (1 - |v_ratio|) where v_ratio = q̇/q̇_max. This captures (A) back-EMF: as motor spins faster, back-EMF opposes applied voltage, reducing current and thus torque. (D) is the macroscopic manifestation: maximum torque at zero speed (stall), decreasing linearly to zero at maximum speed. (B) is incorrect - friction is separate from the torque-speed curve.

      "explanation": "(B) is correct. This tests policy architecture understanding from `sim2simlib/model/config.py` and observation processing. When policies are trained with observation history (e.g., last 3 timesteps of joint positions), they learn to extract derivatives: velocity ≈ (pos_t - pos_{t-1})/dt, acceleration ≈ (vel_t - vel_{t-1})/dt. This is crucial because if IsaacLab training used history but MuJoCo deployment doesn't provide it, the policy loses critical dynamic information. The history must be maintained for transfer.

      "explanation": "(B) is correct. This tests control frequency matching from `sim2simlib/model/config.py` and `sim2sim_base.py`. If IsaacLab training used control_decimation=4 (policy runs every 4 sim steps), the policy learned to produce actions assuming this frequency.
