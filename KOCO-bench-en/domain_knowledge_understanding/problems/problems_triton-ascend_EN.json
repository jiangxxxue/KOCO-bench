      "explanation": "This tests understanding of Ascend NPU's heterogeneous architecture. From compiler.py's _parse_linalg_metadata and the architecture documentation, mix_mode is a compile-time decision that determines which physical compute units (AICore cube vs vector) will execute the kernel. (C) is correct because the mode is fixed at compile time and determines resource allocation. (A) is incorrect - AICore can execute vector operations through its vector units. (B) misrepresents the capabilities - vector cores can perform matrix operations, just less efficiently. (D) is incorrect - there's no dynamic runtime switching within a single kernel; the mode is statically determined.

      "stem": "Why does the tensor kind metadata system distinguish between INPUT_OUTPUT (2) tensors and separate INPUT (0) + OUTPUT (1) tensors in the profiling infrastructure?\n\n- (A) INPUT_OUTPUT tensors require special memory allocation that supports both read and write operations, while INPUT/OUTPUT tensors can use read-only or write-only memory\n- (B) The profiling system reports INPUT_OUTPUT tensors twice (once as input, once as output) to accurately reflect their contribution to both input and output bandwidth\n- (C) INPUT_OUTPUT tensors indicate in-place operations that have different performance characteristics and memory traffic patterns than separate input/output tensors\n- (D) The CANN runtime uses tensor kind to determine whether to perform memory prefetching, which is only beneficial for INPUT tensors",
      "explanation": "This tests understanding of the tensor kind system's semantics. From driver.py's MsprofTensorInfo reporting: (B) is correct - the code explicitly shows that INPUT_OUTPUT tensors are reported twice, once as MSPROF_GE_TENSOR_TYPE_INPUT and once as MSPROF_GE_TENSOR_TYPE_OUTPUT, to accurately reflect their dual role in bandwidth analysis. (A) is incorrect - memory allocation doesn't depend on tensor_kind. (C) is partially true but not the primary reason for the distinction. (D) is incorrect - tensor_kind is for profiling, not runtime optimization. This requires understanding driver.py's profiling code that iterates over tensor_kinds and reports them to MsProf.",
