      "explanation": "This question tests understanding of the LaunchMode design trade-offs in ATB's execution architecture. (B), (F), (C), and (D) are correct. The LaunchMode enum (defined in include/atb/context.h) and implemented through GraphOperation (src/atb/operation/graph_operation.h) and GraphRunner (src/atb/runner/graph_runner.h) represents a fundamental trade-off: KERNEL_LAUNCH_MODE offers flexibility and debuggability at the cost of launch overhead, while GRAPH_LAUNCH_MODE enables graph-level optimizations (memory planning, fusion, batched submission) at the cost of reduced flexibility. (C) correctly identifies that dynamic shapes are more naturally handled in kernel mode. (D) is correct as graph mode can batch multiple kernel launches into a single aclmdlExecute call. (A) is incorrect - while graph mode can reduce launch overhead, for small models with few simple operators, the upfront cost of graph construction and compilation may exceed the runtime savings, making KERNEL_LAUNCH_MODE more efficient. Graph mode does not compile all operators into a single fused kernel; rather, it optimizes scheduling and memory management across operators. (E) is wrong - while graph construction overhead can be amortized through caching, this applies to both training and inference. In fact, graph mode's advantages may be more pronounced in training, which involves more complex computation graphs and more iterations to amortize the graph construction cost. In inference scenarios with simple models or small batches, graph mode's advantages may be less significant than in training.",

More importantly, for tiny models with only a couple of trivial operators the one-time graph-build cost can outweigh the savings, so “significant performance gains even for small models” is too strong a claim.\n\n2. (B) is correct: launching every operator independently makes debugging and profiling per-op trivial, but you pay the per-kernel launch penalty.\n\n3. (C) is correct: when shapes or control-flow decisions can change from step to step, launching kernels one-by-one lets each op react to the new tensor metadata, whereas a pre-built graph must be re-instantiated or made dynamic, which is heavier.\n\n4. (D) is correct: each independent kernel launch usually needs a host-side synchronization or at least a separate CUDA/HCC command submission; a single graph submission can enqueue many nodes in one go, reducing CPU→device traffic.\n\n5. (E) is correct: in inference the same graph is executed thousands of times, so the up-front compilation cost is quickly hidden; during training the graph may be rebuilt every step (because weights/gradients change, or because control flow is data-dependent), so the amortization is weaker.\n\n6. (F) is correct: the whole point of submitting a graph to CANN’s compiler is to let it fuse kernels and reuse memory across op boundaries, but you first have to build and compile that graph, which is not free.\n\nTherefore the true statements are B, C, D, E, F.\n\n\\boxed{B,C,D,E,F}",

Without fusion, the pipeline would be: dequant (write FP16 to HBM) → matmul (read FP16, write FP16) → activation (read FP16, write FP16) → quant (read FP16, write INT8). This defeats the purpose of quantization by requiring full-precision HBM traffic. Fusion keeps the dequantized weights, matmul results, and activated values in L0/L1 buffers, only writing the final quantized result to HBM. This preserves the memory bandwidth advantage of INT8 storage while maintaining computation quality. (A) is incorrect - while Ascend NPU does have specialized computation units, the primary value of fusion is reducing HBM access rather than leveraging hardware data paths. Quantization and dequantization operations don't need to be adjacent to matrix computation to execute; fusion is a software-level optimization choice, not a hardware constraint. (D) is wrong - quantization scale calibration is done offline before model deployment by collecting statistics on a calibration dataset. Fused operators use predetermined quantization parameters and don't dynamically calibrate during forward pass. (B) is false - quantization parameters (like scale factors and zero points) are fixed at operator creation and don't adjust dynamically based on runtime activation values.

      "explanation": "This question tests understanding of fusion design principles. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are correct. The mixkernels directory shows numerous fusion patterns. (A) is correct - the primary benefit of fusion is avoiding HBM writes/reads of intermediate results. RmsNormAndRopeAndReshapeAndCache fuses operations that would otherwise pass tensors through HBM. (B) is correct - operations with compatible compute/memory patterns can share resources efficiently. For example, element-wise operations (RMSNorm, RoPE) can be interleaved with memory operations (reshape, cache write). (C) is correct - if the intermediate tensor is large, the HBM traffic savings are substantial. For long sequences, the normalized tensor before RoPE can be gigabytes. (E) is correct - fusion operators target common patterns in popular architectures, maximizing reuse. RMSNorm+RoPE appears in every LLaMA layer. (D) is incorrect - while reducing kernel launch overhead is a benefit of fusion, the primary value comes from avoiding intermediate HBM traffic, not from the computational cost of individual operations. Fusing lightweight operations that produce large intermediate tensors can be more beneficial than fusing computationally expensive operations with small intermediates. (F) is wrong - heterogeneous fusion (mixing operation types with different memory access patterns) is often most beneficial. The key is sequential dependency and intermediate tensor elimination, not uniformity of memory access patterns. Memory bank conflicts are managed through careful tiling and scheduling, not by avoiding heterogeneous fusion.",
      "pred_raw": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Fusion is primarily about eliminating memory traffic.  \n   - If two ops are back-to-back and the first writes an intermediate tensor to HBM that the second immediately reads, fusing them keeps that tensor in on-chip SRAM/registers.  \n   - Therefore (A) is correct: sequential dependence with an intermediate that would otherwise hit HBM is the textbook fusion trigger.\n\n2. Once ops are fused, the compiler schedules them together.  \n   - If their arithmetic intensity and memory footprints are alike, the fused kernel can achieve better instruction-level parallelism and reuse the same cache lines.  \n   - Hence (B) is correct.\n\n3. The traffic saved is proportional to the size of the intermediate tensor.  \n   - If that intermediate is large compared with the final output, the bytes saved dominate the traffic budget.  \n   - Thus (C) is correct.\n\n4. Kernel-launch overhead is tiny (microseconds) versus memory-bandwidth time for large tensors.  \n   - Fusion is not driven by “save a launch” but by “save the bytes.”  \n   - Picking only the heaviest single ops (D) can miss many memory-bound sequences, so (D) is not a key principle.\n\n5. Operators that appear together in widely used model blocks (RMSNorm → RoPE in every LLaMA layer) give you one fused kernel that is invoked millions of times across different models.  \n   - Reuse amortizes the engineering cost of writing the fused kernel.  \n   - Therefore (E) is correct.\n\n6. Ascend NPUs have banked shared memory; mixing scatter/gather with sequential patterns can cause conflicts, but the hardware and compiler can often hide them, and real fusions (RMS+RoPE+reshape) already mix patterns successfully.  \n   - Avoiding fusion solely on “different access patterns” would forbid most useful fusions, so (F) is overly restrictive and is not a guiding principle.\n\nCorrect choices: A, B, C, E\n\n\\boxed{A,B,C,E}",

(A) is correct - the same Operation can use different Runners based on LaunchMode or other factors, changing execution strategy without API changes. (E) is incorrect - both run on host; device execution is via kernel launch. (F) is wrong - inference equally benefits from this separation. Inference deployment may need to switch execution strategies across different hardware platforms and performance requirements. For example, edge device inference might use kernel mode to reduce memory footprint, while cloud batch inference uses graph mode for higher throughput. Operation/Runner separation makes this flexibility possible without modifying upper-level model code. This architectural advantage is equally important for both training and inference.",
