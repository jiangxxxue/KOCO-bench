This design choice reflects a fundamental trade-off in stereo vision systems: pre-rectification simplifies baseline implementations by ensuring epipolar lines are horizontal, enabling efficient stereo matching. The code in dataset_euroc.py uses cv2.stereoRectify() to compute rectification transforms, then cv2.remap() to transform images, overwriting originals. This assumes baselines expect rectified input (common in SLAM systems like ORB-SLAM2/3). The interaction between Datasets/dataset_euroc.py (rectification) and Baselines/BaselineVSLAMLab.py (execution) shows this preprocessing contract.
