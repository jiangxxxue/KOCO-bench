The T-pose serves as a canonical configuration where we can compute the rotation offset needed to align corresponding bones. For example, if source's upper arm points in direction v_s and target's points in direction v_t (both in their respective T-poses), the rotation offset R satisfies: R * v_s = v_t. This offset is then applied to all motion frames. Both must be in the same pose type (T-pose) so the bone directions are comparable. (A) is wrong - joint counts can differ.
