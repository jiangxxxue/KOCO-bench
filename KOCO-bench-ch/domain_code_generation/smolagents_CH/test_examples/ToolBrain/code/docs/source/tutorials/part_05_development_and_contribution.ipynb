    "# Part 5: Development and Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "ToolBrain is designed to be a flexible, extensible framework, and we welcome contributions from the open-source community. Whether you want to integrate your own custom agent, add new features, or fix a bug, this guide will help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing a Custom Adapter for Other Agent Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "ToolBrain's power comes from its ability to adapt to different agentic frameworks. This is achieved through the **Adapter Pattern**. The `SmolAgentAdapter` is the built-in adapter for agents from the `smolagents` library, but you can write your own to make ToolBrain work with frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, or your own custom agent implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an adapter is to act as a bridge, translating the specific methods and data structures of an external agent framework into the standard format that the `Brain` understands (specifically, the `Trace` and `Turn` objects).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `BaseAgentAdapter` Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a new adapter, you need to create a class that implements the core methods defined by ToolBrain's adapter protocol. While there isn't a strict abstract base class, your adapter must have the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`__init__(self, agent, config)`**\n",
    "    -   The constructor should accept the agent instance you want to wrap and a configuration dictionary.\n",
    "    -   It should store the agent for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`run(self, query: str) -> Tuple[Trace, Any, List[Any]]`**\n",
    "    -   This is the most important method. It is responsible for executing the agent to solve the given `query`.\n",
    "    -   It must orchestrate the agent's entire execution and, at the end, return three things:\n",
    "        1.  `trace`: A complete `Trace` object (`List[Turn]`) that meticulously records every step of the agent's process.\n",
    "        2.  `rl_input`: The specific data required by the learning algorithm. For transformer-based models, this is typically the list of formatted chat segments or tokens that can be fed directly into the model for training.\n",
    "        3.  `raw_memory_steps`: The raw, unprocessed history or memory objects from the agent's internal state. This is useful for advanced reward functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **`get_trainable_model(self)`**\n",
    "    -   This method must return the underlying trainable model object (e.g., the `torch.nn.Module` or Hugging Face `PreTrainedModel`). The `Brain` needs this to perform backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **`get_callable_tools(self)`**\n",
    "    -   This method should return a list of the raw tool functions that the agent can use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your adapter is written, you would modify the `Brain`'s internal `_get_adapter_for_agent` method to recognize and initialize your custom adapter when it sees your agent type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing to ToolBrain\n",
    "\n",
    "We encourage and appreciate community contributions! Here’s how you can help:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas for Contribution:**\n",
    "-   **New Reward Functions**: Have a clever way to score agent behavior? Add it to `toolbrain/rewards.py`.\n",
    "-   **New Examples or Tutorials**: If you use ToolBrain for a cool project, share it as an example.\n",
    "-   **Bug Fixes**: Find a bug? Submit a fix!\n",
    "-   **Documentation**: Improving documentation, docstrings, and tutorials is invaluable.\n",
    "-   **New Adapters**: If you build an adapter for a popular framework, consider contributing it to the library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contribution Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create your own copy of the [ToolBrain repository](https://github.com/ToolBrain/ToolBrain) on GitHub.\n",
    "2.  **Create a Branch**: Make a new branch for your feature or bug fix (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/new-reward-function`).\n",
    "3.  **Make Your Changes**: Write your code or documentation.\n",
    "4.  **Add Tests**: If you add a new feature, please add corresponding tests to ensure it works correctly and protect against future breakage.\n",
    "5.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and open a pull request to the main ToolBrain repository. Provide a clear description of your changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for helping us build a better framework for the entire community!"
