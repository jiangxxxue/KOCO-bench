    "# Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will guide you through preparing your local machine to use ToolBrain. By the end, you'll have a clean environment with all the necessary dependencies installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0: Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a best practice to work in an isolated Python environment. You can use `conda` or `venv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Conda\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create --name toolbrain python=3.10\n",
    "conda activate toolbrain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using venv\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Install ToolBrain library\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you install the library either from PyPI or from its Github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "### From PyPI:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install toolbrain\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or \n",
    "\n",
    "### from the Github repository:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone the official ToolBrain repository from GitHub to get all the library code and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone git@github.com:ToolBrain/ToolBrain.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the cloned folder and install the library:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ToolBrain\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will install ToolBrain along with all its core dependencies, such as `torch`, `transformers`, and `smolagents`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Set Up API Keys (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some advanced features and examples in ToolBrain, like using a powerful LLM-as-a-Judge or certain language models, require API keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a file named `.env` in the root of the `ToolBrain` directory. This file will securely store your API keys as environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# .env file\n",
    "\n",
    "# For using models from Hugging Face\n",
    "HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=\"hf_...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# For using OpenAI models (e.g., as a judge)\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=\"sk_...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# For using Google Gemini models (e.g., as a judge)\n",
    "GEMINI_API_KEY=\"AIzaSy...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The library uses the `dotenv` package to automatically load these variables when you run the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Your environment is now set up! You're ready to move on to the next tutorial and run your first training script.\n"
