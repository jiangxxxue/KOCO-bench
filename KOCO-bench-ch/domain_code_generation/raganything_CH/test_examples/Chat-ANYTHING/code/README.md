# 💬 Chat-Anything  
> Chat with your data, the web, and everything in between.

---

### 🚀 Introduction  

**Chat-Anything** is my custom evolution of **RAG-Anything** and **rag-web-ui** — a unified, intelligent chat system built to interact with *any* knowledge source.  

It combines **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with a modern **web interface**, enhanced by **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to support **live web search** and context injection from real-time data.  

In simple terms:  
> It’s a chat app that can reason, search, and learn — all in one place.

### ✨ Why I Built It  

While experimenting with **RAG-Anything**, I realized how powerful it could be when paired with a smooth web UI and dynamic context updates.  

So I decided to merge:  
- 🧩 **RAG-Anything** → for its modular multimodal RAG pipeline.  
- 🖥️ **rag-web-ui** → for its clean and interactive frontend.  
- 🌐 **MCP (Web Search)** → to let the model pull *fresh* info directly from the internet.  

Now, **Chat-Anything** lets you explore any topic — powered by your own files, your knowledge base, and the entire web.
